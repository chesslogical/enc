# 🔐 Why Use Zig for Encryption Apps?

Zig is a modern low-level programming language that's well-suited for building efficient, safe, and portable encryption tools — especially when simplicity and performance matter. If you are too foolish to use Rust, zig is almost a good option :)

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Zig for Encryption

### ⚡ 1. **Minimal Overhead**
- No runtime, GC, or hidden abstractions
- You control every byte and cycle
- Great for small, standalone CLI tools

### 🔧 2. **Powerful Standard Library**
- Includes fast and well-designed crypto primitives:
  - `std.crypto.aead.aes_gcm.Aes256Gcm`
  - Hashing (SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2)
  - Secure random generation
- Built-in memory allocators and file I/O
- No need for OpenSSL or third-party bloat

### 🛡️ 3. **Safer Than C**
- Bounds-checked arrays (in debug mode)
- Option types for null safety (`?T`)
- Error unions enforce handling (`!void`)
- Explicit alloc/free — no implicit memory leaks

### 💡 4. **Great Developer Experience**
- Easy to start: single-file apps work out of the box
- Just run: `zig build-exe my_tool.zig`
- Cross-compilation built in
- Fast compilation (no cargo-like wait)

### 🔁 5. **Portable and Cross-Platform**
- Create native `.exe`, `.bin`, `.wasm`, or `.elf` files
- Compile for Windows, Linux, macOS from any OS
- No dynamic linking headaches

## ✅ When Zig is a Great Fit

- Small to medium-sized encryption tools
- Self-contained command-line apps
- File encryption/decryption utilities
- Low-level crypto experiments
- Projects where C is “too risky” and Rust is “too heavy”

---

## ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

- Zig doesn’t enforce memory safety like Rust
- No borrow checker or auto-freeing of memory
- You are responsible for lifecycle and correctness

> That said: Zig gives you **more safety than C**, with fewer hoops than Rust.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Encrypting and decrypting files using AES-256-GCM:

```zig
const Aes256Gcm = std.crypto.aead.aes_gcm.Aes256Gcm;
// Encrypt plaintext with: nonce + key + tag
```

---

## 📘 Summary

Zig is:
- 🛠️ Low-level but readable
- 🔒 Secure by design (when used properly)
- 🧳 Perfect for tools that need to be fast, portable, and reliable

It's a fantastic choice for encryption tools when you want **control, performance, and simplicity** — without the overhead of C or Rust.
