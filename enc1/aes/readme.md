# aes

ONE command! for example -

aes a.txt

it will auto encrypt or decrypt a.txt

requires key.key be in same dir

Bam! AES-256-GCM-SIV file encryption.



NOTE-  Encrypts entirely in memory. On a gaming computer with 64 gb ddr5 this is not much of an issue. For a laptop with 16 gb of ram, you would not want to try to encrypt a 16 gb file because the system uses some of your ram.
