A huge collection of encryption apps that ai (chat gpt) made. If you like a particular app you had better make your own copy of it because all the apps here are subject to being updated at any time. In the new age of Ai, all the articles that tout the benefits of versioning are outdated. My idea of versioning is to have the best model of ai audit the code. I do not see a need to keep older versions of the code. I am not worried all day long about bugs. Even in production, if you encounter a bug, feed the code to ai and have it fixed. Keeping the last 1000 versions of your code archived is just silly. It is a different take ... you will not find that take in textbooks lol. It is how i roll tho, deal with it.
